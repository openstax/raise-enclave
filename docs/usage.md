# RAISE Enclave Usage

This documentation is intended for researchers that want to use enclaves to analyze RAISE data. It assumes some basic familiarity with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Operational model

RAISE enclaves allow users to write their analysis code with the programming language and framework of their choice with the following constraints:

* The code and all dependencies must be packaged into a Docker image
* The code must not rely on any network access during runtime (network connectivity is blocked during execution of an enclave and attempts to access external endpoints will result in runtime failures)

The contract between the runtime and any container is fairly straight forward:

* Input data is staged at a path exposed via the `DATA_INPUT_DIR` environment variable. Users can read the environment variable and append the relative path for any input files necessary for analysis.

* Analysis outputs should be written to the path exposed via the `RESULT_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable. Any files written outside of this path will be lost at the end of the execution. Any files written to this path will also be subject to review. Only the following file types are currently allowed / supported (files of any other type will be redacted from the output as part of review):
    * CSV
    * PNG / JPG
    * PDF

A relatively trivial example of an analysis can be found in this repo [here](../examples/quiz-analyzer).

## Data model

:warning: :construction: The RAISE enclave data model is still in early stages and breaking changes could be introduced as things evolve. :construction: :warning:

Enclave containers can access data serialized in CSV format. Data files are populated in subdirectories dedicated for specific academic years / semesters:

| Path | Academic year / semester |
| - | - |
| `{DATA_INPUT_DIR}/ay2022` | Academic year spanning Fall 2022 through Spring 2023 |
| `{DATA_INPUT_DIR}/ay2023` | Academic year spanning Fall 2023 through Spring 2024 |

Each path above includes the following data files:

| CSV | Description |
| - | - |
| [assessments.csv](#assessmentscsv) | The set of assessments (Moodle quizzes) in the course associating name to a unique ID |
| [content_loads.csv](#content_loadscsv) | Events that occur whenever users load a specific piece of content in `course_contents.csv` |
| [courses.csv](#coursescsv) | A list of courses associating name to a unique ID |
| [course_contents.csv](#course_contentscsv) | Information about what part of the course a specific content ID can be associated with |
| [enrollments.csv](#enrollmentscsv) | Enrollment information mapping users to specific courses and their corresponding role in that course |
| [grades.csv](#gradescsv) | Gradebook data for a student based upon from assessments (these are the maximum of all attempts on the assessment when multiple exist) |
| [ib_input_instances.csv](#ib_input_instancescsv) | Details on instances of open input interactives in the course |
| [ib_input_submissions.csv](#ib_input_submissionscsv) | Events that occur when a user submits to an open input interactive |
| [ib_pset_problem_attempts.csv](#ib_pset_problem_attemptscsv) | Events that occur when a user submits to a pset problem interactive |
| [ib_pset_problems.csv](#ib_pset_problemscsv) | Details on instances of pset problem interactives in the course |
| [quiz_attempts.csv](#quiz_attemptscsv) | Attempt details for Moodle quizzes |
| [quiz_attempt_multichoice_responses.csv](#quiz_attempt_multichoice_responsescsv) | Question level responses on a quiz attempt |
| [quiz_questions.csv](#quiz_questionscsv) | Details on the contents of each assessment mapping questions to each assessment |
| [quiz_question_contents.csv](#quiz_question_contentscsv) | Details on the content of each quiz question by ID |
| [quiz_multichoice_answers.csv](#quiz_multichoice_answerscsv) | Details on option choices for `multichoice` quiz questions |
| [users.csv](#userscsv) | User information |

In addition, prejoined view tables are available for easy data query:
| CSV | Description | Source data
| - | - | - |
| [view_enrollment.csv](#view_enrollmentcsv) | Enhanced enrollment information with course ID, course name, user ID and user role | `enrollments.csv`, `courses.csv`
| [view_ib_input.csv](#view_ib_inputcsv) | Event data for open input interactive, with additional information of the question and relevant content | `ib_input_submissions.csv`, `ib_input_instances.csv`, `course_contents.csv`
| [view_ib_pset.csv](#view_ib_psetcsv) | Event data for pset problem interactive, with additional information of the question and relevant content | `ib_pset_problem_attempts.csv`, `ib_pset_problems.csv`, `course_contents.csv`
| [view_quiz.csv](#view_quizcsv) | User responses to quizzes, with additional information of item, assessment, and quiz attempt | `quiz_attempts.csv`, `assessments.csv`, `quiz_question_contents.csv`, `quiz_attempt_multichoice_responses.csv`, `quiz_multichoice_answers.csv`

## Development and testing

Users can easily test their code / Docker images locally with fake datasets. The following example steps assume test data has been populated at `$PWD/enclave-input`:

```bash
$ docker image build -t enclave_container .
$ docker run --rm -e DATA_INPUT_DIR=/input -e RESULT_OUTPUT_DIR=/output -v $PWD/enclave-input:/input -v $PWD/enclave-output:/output enclave_container
```

Expected outputs can be found at `$PWD/enclave-output` in the development environment.
